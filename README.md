# Python IDLE platform
# MovieTrailerWebsite folder consists of three files.
#     1. fresh_tomatoes.py
#     2. media.py
#     3. movieInstances.py
# You would have to save(File --> Save or Ctrl+S) these files and
# then compile(Run --> Run Module or press F5) them.
# This has to be done in an order
#     First--> fresh_tomatoes.py
#     Second--> media.py
#     Third-->  movieInstances.py
# Order is important as one file is dependent on other.
# If everything goes right a message appears on the Python Shell otherwise error will be indicated.
# Only after Running movieInstance.py does the webPage FreshTomatoes open
# 1. By moving the mouse you can highlite poster image.
# 2. By moving the mouse on the "StoryLine" link a small
#    text popup will give you the story line of that perticular movie.
# 3. If you click on the Poster image YouTube trailer will popup.
#    You can either close it by clicking on the X or click anywhere
#    else on the webpage
#
# I chose harry potter series to be showcased on this website.
# But as this series consists of 8 movies a three column layout of the page
# was not asthetic. So change it to 4.


#   Changes that were made to the original fresh_tomatoes.py file.

# 1. Original web page displays three movies in a row I want to change it to FOUR.
# 2. If you hover on the link 'Storyline' the movie_storyline should be visible.
# 3. Changed the background, white was boring for a movie!

# All these changes are commented in code of fresh_tomatoes.py file.
